\section{Bayesian filtering}

The object is to optimally estimate the state (jammer positions) $x_t$
based on all measurements up to time $t$, $y_{1:t}$.  This feat is
accomplished with a recursion, given an initial distribution for state
$x_0$ which in this case is uniform over the grid.

Predict step: (follows from definition of conditional probability and
the Markov Property)

$$P(x_{t+1}|y_{1:t}) = \sum_{x_t} P(x_{t+1}|x_t) P(x_t|y_{1:t})$$

Update step: (follows from Bayes Rule and Markov Property)

$$P(x_{t+1}|y_{1:t+1}) \sim P(y_{t+1}|x_{t+1}) P(x_{t+1}|y_{1:t})$$

The bug is in the predict step.  The probability places equal
probability for movement to each neighbor in the grid.
